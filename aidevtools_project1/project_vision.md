# Project Vision & Future Roadmap

## Future Capabilities
- **Universal Sourcing**: Extend beyond YouTube to support ingestion from:
    - Web URLs (Articles, Blogs)
    - Local Documents (PDFs, Markdown, Text files)
- **Live Interaction**: "Learn by Talking" interface using a Live API for real-time voice conversation with the material.

## Naming Concepts
Ideas for the application name reflecting these capabilities:

### Top Recommendations
- **Polymath**: Represents wide-ranging knowledge and the ability to learn from any source.
- **Socratic**: Emphasizes the "learning through dialogue" aspect (Chat/Quiz).

### Other Strong Contenders
- **OmniLearn** / **Omni**: Universal learning.
- **Nexus**: A central point for all knowledge sources.
- **Synthetix**: Synthesizing different inputs.
- **Osmosis**: Effortless absorption of knowledge.
- **Aura**: An intelligent field around your documents.
