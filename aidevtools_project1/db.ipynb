Put another way, if I need to, Google can weather a downturn, but the bubble bursting or even maybe deflating could be existential for Altman and OpenAI.

       "1  Welcome back. Alphabet is the only Mag 7 stock positive on the week and its renewed AI momentum is worrying one of Google's biggest AI rivals according to new reporting. Dear Drabosa has more in today's tech check. Tell us all about it D. >> This is a good one. Candasa. So, according to a memo obtained by the information, Sam Alman told his employees that he expects quote the vibes to be rough out there for a bit as Google's recent progress could create some temporary economic headwinds for them. Now, that line temporary economic headwinds, it gets at this emerging narrative in the AI race, hype versus hard economics. And Google's numbers, they are first in class. gross margin of 32%, cash reserves $112 billion. Free cash flow over the last quarter $ 24 billion. Now, OpenAI, on the other hand, isn't even profitable. It's burning cash fast, and it has to raise again and again just to keep pace with a company that can fund its entire AI strategy out of search profits. put another way if I need to. Google can weather a downturn, but the bubble bursting or even maybe deflating could be existential for Altman and Open AI. So when you hear Google's leaders, contestas start talking about a bubble this week like we have from Senator Pachai and Demisabas, you got to wonder who that really hurts and who it could help. But a very interesting change and dynamic over the last few months. And the the other interesting thing and we had briefly touched on this yesterday D when we were talking is that Google has a lot of experience in consumerf facing products. And so the idea that you would be able to use your AI in a way that is accessible to people whether they're small business owners or uh factory workers or entrepreneurs or just you know my mom that they would be able to give those products in in a way that's accessible. you're hitting at really the core of the bull thesis around Google right now and that is the full stack. It has the distribution, the ecosystem, the chips, the models, the products. I mean even with the Gemini 3 uh release this week, they didn't just release it to subscribers or to people who are looking for AI chat bots. They released it across AI mode. So that's potentially billions of users who aren't even necessarily looking for a chatbot. They're getting the power of, you know, the best model out there right now. So even your mom who's maybe using a chat GBT a Gemini I don't know if she's using a number of them. I told my mom that she has to she might be using you know Gemini 3 and thinking this is the best one and then that may be sticky because she's using Google or she's trained on Google. So um certainly flexing that and it's funny to go back to Contessa you know Satiana's Nadella's comments from not all that long ago saying that he wanted to make Google dance. They're dancing and I think they're having fun doing  "
